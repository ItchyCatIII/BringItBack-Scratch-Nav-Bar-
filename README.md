# BringItBack-Scratch-Nav-Bar-
This can change the "tips" link in Scratch's navigation bar to a link to the discussion forums (how it was before July 5th).
It is designed to work in Google Chrome, as an extension.  At least as far as I know, it does not work in other browsers.

If you use this and want to visit the tips page, the URL is https://scratch.mit.edu/tips.  There's a link to it on Scratch's
footer under "Support".

# Instructions For Usage
1. Download this repository and unzip it as a folder.
2. On Google Chrome, type "Chrome://extensions" in your address bar and press enter.
3. If you have not checked off "developer mode" (at the top of the screen, to the right of the word "extensions" and directly
   above the enable/disable checkbox if you have any extensions downloaded).
4. Click "Load Unpacked Extension", and find and select this repository.
5. It should enable automatically (otherwise enable it), and you should see an incorrectly sized logo (which is a picture
   of a link to the discussion forums in the Scratch navigation bar) in your extensions toolbar.  You can feel free to right
   click on this and click "Hide in Chrome Menu" if you want to, although it is not necessary.
6. Each time you visit scratch.mit.edu, the navigation bar should be modified to give you a link to the forums instead of the
   tips page.
